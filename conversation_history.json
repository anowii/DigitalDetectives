    "hello": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    "Is banana a fruit?": "Yes, a banana is indeed a fruit.",
    "can you tell me more about that?": "I'd be happy to provide more information about bananas as fruits.\n\nBananas are one of the most widely consumed fruits in the world. They belong to the genus Musa and are native to Southeast Asia. Bananas are typically yellow when they're mature, but they can range from green to purple, depending on the variety.\n\nFrom a botanical standpoint, bananas are a type of herbaceous fruit, meaning they grow on large plants with giant leaves that resemble ferns. The banana plant is actually a pseudostem, which means it's made up of tightly wrapped leaf sheaths rather than a true stem.\n\nBananas are also rich in nutrients like potassium, vitamin C, and fiber, making them a popular choice for snacking and adding to various recipes. They're relatively low in calories and have a number of health benefits when consumed as part of a balanced diet.\n\nThere are many different types of bananas, including the Cavendish banana (which is the most commonly consumed variety) and plantain bananas, which are starchier and often cooked before eating. Bananas are also an important crop for many countries around the world, with major producers like Costa Rica, Philippines, and Ecuador.\n\nI hope that's a helpful expansion on our previous conversation!",
    "can you add 3+2?": "The answer to \"can you add 3+2?\" is 5.",
    "and 12*5-7(1*4)?": "To solve the expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply 12 and 5: 12*5 = 60\n2. Calculate 7 times (1*4): 7*(1*4) = 7*4 = 28\n3. Subtract 28 from 60: 60 - 28 = 32\n\nThe answer to the expression is 32.",
    "what fruit did I ask about?": "You asked about bananas."
