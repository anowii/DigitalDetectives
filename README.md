# Digital Detectives 

**Rules**
- Create your own branch 
- Commit,pull, etc. to your own branch 
- We create a **main** branch to commit to when final results have been reached
- Comment code and commits
-  Add requierments.txt
- Going forward only push actual code and req.txt onto git

**Everytime I open a new terminal I have to add the following:**
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate       
```
